# BreastCancerAutoSegmentor Description

Welcome to BreastCancerAutoSegmentor (BC-AutoSegmentor) repository.
BC-AutoSegmentor toolkit was developed by deep nueral networks with more than 1000 patients with breast DCE-MRI from multi-centers and multi-regions. The toolkit showed in good performance and generalizability in independent external validation. More details are avaiable in our research paper comming soon. 

Note that, the models avaiable in the current repository is only for reserach purposes.
